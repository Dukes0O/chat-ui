# Project Progress: LAN AI Chat UI (Vanilla + Vite)

_Last updated: 2025-04-17_

## What Has Been Accomplished
- **Reviewed the implementation plan** (`lan_ai_chat_plan.md`).
- **Decided on front-end stack:** Chose Vanilla JavaScript with Vite (no React or frameworks).
- **Manually scaffolded the Vite project** to bypass CLI interaction issues.
  - Created: `index.html`, `main.js`, `style.css`, `vite.config.js`, and `package.json`.
- **Installed dependencies** and successfully started the development server (`npm run dev`).
- **UI skeleton fully tested locally:** All major components (Sidebar, ChatView, Composer, ModelPicker, CostMeter) are functional with mock data and ready for API integration.
- **Modularized UI components**: Created Sidebar, ChatView, Composer, ModelPicker, and CostMeter as vanilla JS modules in `components/` and refactored `main.js` to use them.
- **UI architecture matches plan**: The front-end now reflects the architecture and component map from `lan_ai_chat_plan.md`.
- **Added one-click startup script** (`start-all.bat`) to launch both backend (FastAPI) and frontend (Vite) servers in separate windows for easy development.
- **Updated backend (`main.py`)** to support direct execution with `python main.py` by adding a `__main__` block that starts the FastAPI server with uvicorn. This enables the batch script to work seamlessly.
- **Markdown rendering improved:** Chat UI now renders AI and user messages with correct bolding, bullets, and newline spacing. Output is much more readable and visually appealing.
- **Persistent chat memory:** Chat context window increased to 30 messages. Both user and AI messages are now stored and displayed in order, supporting multi-turn conversations.
- **Table and math formatting fixes:** Markdown tables are auto-corrected for common AI formatting errors; math expressions in the format `[ \sqrt{100} ]` are auto-converted for KaTeX rendering (though full math rendering troubleshooting remains open).
- **KaTeX math rendering integration:** KaTeX is loaded in the frontend to support LaTeX-style math, but further troubleshooting is needed to ensure all math expressions render as expected.
- **Streaming duplication resolved:** Only the final, formatted AI response is shown after each turn; placeholder and duplicate messages are removed.

## What Hasn't Worked
- **Vite CLI interactive prompts** cannot be used in the current environment (no terminal interaction possible).
- **Automated project creation via `npm create vite@latest`** fails due to inability to select a framework interactively.

## Needs Real Logic (Currently Mocked)
- Sidebar (sessions): Replace mock session list with real `/sessions` API integration.
- ChatView (messages): Replace mock messages with real `/sessions/{session_id}/messages` API integration and streaming logic.
- Composer (send): Wire up to `/sessions/{session_id}/messages` and `/upload` endpoints.
- ModelPicker: Populate from real `/models` endpoint.
- CostMeter: Update from real session cost data (API or SSE).

### Backend
- All session and message storage is in-memory; migrate to SQLite (or Postgres) for persistence.
- File upload currently saves to disk, but files are not associated with users or sessions.
- Only OpenAI model is implemented; others are placeholders.

## Outstanding Tasks
- Integrate real API endpoints for sessions, messages, models, file uploads, and costs.
- Implement real-time streaming for model responses in ChatView.
- Add session CRUD (create/delete).
- Polish UI, add error handling, and write user/developer documentation.
- Replace all mock data and logic with real API calls and persistence.
- Add per-user data isolation (schema changes, user_id association on all data).
- Implement lightweight authentication (username + access key per user).
- Ensure files and sessions are only accessible by their owner.
- Update documentation and API surface to reflect new authentication and data isolation.
- **[OPEN] KaTeX math rendering troubleshooting:** Math expressions are auto-converted and KaTeX is loaded, but further debugging is required to ensure all math displays correctly in both user and AI messages.

## Next Steps
1. Begin API/back-end development per the implementation plan.
2. Wire up front-end components to real API endpoints as they become available.
3. Continue to update this documentation as progress is made.

## How to Start the App (Quick Reference)

### 1. Start the Backend (FastAPI)
```sh
cd C:\Users\kyleb\CascadeProjects\chat-ui-api\backend
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
# (Optional, only if you haven’t installed requirements)
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```
- Backend available at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

### 2. Start the Frontend (Vite Dev Server)
```sh
cd C:\Users\kyleb\CascadeProjects\chat-ui-api\chat-ui
# (Optional, only if you haven’t installed dependencies)
npm install
npm run dev
```
- Frontend available at the URL shown in the terminal (usually [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000))

### 3. Access the App
- Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### 4. Stopping the App
- Press `CTRL+C` in each terminal window.

**Tip:** For LAN access, use your local IP (e.g., `http://192.168.x.x:3000`) and ensure firewall rules allow connections.

## Backend/Frontend Integration & Current State (2025-04-17)

### Summary of Current State
- **Backend (FastAPI) and Frontend (Vite/JS) are both running and communicating.**
- **All core endpoints are implemented and reachable.**
- **Sessions and messages are stored in memory (no persistent DB).**
- **OpenAI API integration is active; vision support via o4-mini is stubbed for demo.**

### What We've Done
- Fixed backend `/sessions/{session_id}/messages` endpoint to accept JSON bodies (aligns with frontend requests).
- Verified `/models` and `/sessions` endpoints work from browser/curl.
- Confirmed frontend loads, sessions can be created and selected, and chat UI is interactive.
- Confirmed backend and frontend are using the correct Python environment and Node modules.

### What's Been Tested
- Backend endpoints: `/models`, `/sessions`, `/chat`, `/sessions/{id}/messages` (GET/POST), `/upload`, `/files/{id}`.
- Frontend session creation, session selection, and chat message sending (including streaming responses).
- CORS and environment variable setup.

### What Remains Outstanding
- **422 (Unprocessable Content) error** when POSTing to `/sessions/{session_id}/messages` (despite backend expecting JSON body). Possible causes: stale backend process, mismatch in request/response, or caching.
- **JSON parse warnings in frontend** due to incomplete or malformed streamed JSON chunks from `/chat` endpoint.
- **No persistent storage:** All sessions/messages are lost on server restart.
- **Vision model (`o4-mini`) is demo-only.**
- **No authentication or user management.**
- **Error handling and UX polish needed for production use.**

### Next Steps
- Double-check backend process is running latest code (restart if needed).
- Investigate and resolve 422 error for `/sessions/{session_id}/messages`.
- Refine backend streaming to ensure only complete JSON objects are sent per line.
- Consider adding persistent storage (e.g., SQLite) for sessions/messages.
- Add authentication, better error handling, and production hardening as needed.
